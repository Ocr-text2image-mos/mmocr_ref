Abstract: 'Recently, segmentation-based methods are quite popular in
scene text detection, as the segmentation results can more ac-
curately describe scene text of various shapes such as curve
text. However, the post-processing of binarization is essen-
tial for segmentation-based detection, which converts proba-
bility maps produced by a segmentation method into bound-
ing boxes/regions of text. In this paper, we propose a mod-
ule named Differentiable Binarization (DB), which can per-
form the binarization process in a segmentation network. Op-
timized along with a DB module, a segmentation network can
adaptively set the thresholds for binarization, which not only
simplifies the post-processing but also enhances the perfor-
mance of text detection. Based on a simple segmentation net-
work, we validate the performance improvements of DB on
five benchmark datasets, which consistently achieves state-
of-the-art results, in terms of both detection accuracy and
speed. In particular, with a light-weight backbone, the per-
formance improvements by DB are significant so that we
can look for an ideal tradeoff between detection accuracy
and efficiency. Specifically, with a backbone of ResNet-18,
our detector achieves an F-measure of 82.8, running at 62
FPS, on the MSRA-TD500 dataset. Code is available at:
