Abstract: 'A challenging aspect of scene text recognition is to handle text with
distortions or irregular layout. In particular, perspective text and curved
text are common in natural scenes and are difficult to recognize. In this work,
we introduce ASTER, an end-to-end neural network model that comprises a
rectification network and a recognition network. The rectification network
adaptively transforms an input image into a new one, rectifying the text in it.
It is powered by a flexible Thin-Plate Spline transformation which handles a
variety of text irregularities and is trained without human annotations. The
recognition network is an attentional sequence-to-sequence model that predicts
a character sequence directly from the rectified image. The whole model is
trained end to end, requiring only images and their groundtruth text. Through
extensive experiments, we verify the effectiveness of the rectification and
demonstrate the state-of-the-art recognition performance of ASTER. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that ASTER is a powerful component in end-to-end recognition
systems, for its ability to enhance the detector.'
