Abstract: 'In this paper, we propose a novel method, aggregation cross-entropy
(ACE), for sequence recognition from a brand new perspective. The ACE loss
function exhibits competitive performance to CTC and the attention mechanism,
with much quicker implementation (as it involves only four fundamental
formulas), faster inference\back-propagation (approximately O(1) in parallel),
less storage requirement (no parameter and negligible runtime memory), and
convenient employment (by replacing CTC with ACE). Furthermore, the proposed
ACE loss function exhibits two noteworthy properties: (1) it can be directly
applied for 2D prediction by flattening the 2D prediction into 1D prediction
as the input and (2) it requires only characters and their numbers in the
sequence annotation for supervision, which allows it to advance beyond sequence
recognition, e.g., counting problem.'
