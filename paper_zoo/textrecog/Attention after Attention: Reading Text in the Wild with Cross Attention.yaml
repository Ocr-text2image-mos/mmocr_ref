Abstract: 'Recent methods mostly regarded scene text recognition as a
sequence-to-sequence problem. These methods roughly transform the image into a
feature sequence and use the algorithms for sequence-to-sequence problem like
CTC or attention to decode the characters. However, text in images is distributed
in a two-dimensional (2D) space and roughly converting the features of text
into a feature sequence may introduce extra noise, especially if the text is
irregular. In this paper, we propose a novel framework named cross attention
network, which learns to attend to local features of a 2D feature map
corresponding to individual characters. The network contains two 1D attention
networks, which operates harmoniously in two directions. Thus, one of the
attention modules vertically attends to the features corresponding to the whole
text of 2D features and the other horizontal module selects the local features
to decode individual characters. Extensive experiments are performed on various
regular benchmarks, including SVT, ICDAR2003, ICDAR2013, and IIIT5K-Words,
which demonstrate that the proposed model either outperforms or is comparable
to all previous methods. Moreover, the model is evaluated on irregular benchmarks
including SVTPerspective, CUTE80 and ICDAR 2015. The performance on irregular
benchmarks shows the robustness of our model.'
