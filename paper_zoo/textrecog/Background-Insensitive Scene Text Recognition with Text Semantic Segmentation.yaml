Abstract: 'Scene Text Recognition (STR) has many important applications in
computer vision. Complex backgrounds continue to be a big challenge for STR
because they interfere with text feature extraction. Many existing methods
use attentional regions, bounding boxes or polygons to reduce such
interference. However, the text regions located by these methods still contain
much undesirable background interference. In this paper, we propose a
Background-Insensitive approach BINet by explicitly leveraging the text
Semantic Segmentation (SSN) to extract texts more accurately. SSN is trained
on a set of existing segmentation data, whose volume is only 0.03% of STR
training data. This prevents the large-scale pixel-level annotations of the
 STR training data. To effectively utilize the segmentation cues, we design new
 segmentation refinement and embedding blocks for refining text-masks and
 reinforcing visual features. Additionally, we propose an efficient pipeline
 that utilizes Synthetic Initialization (SI) for STR models trained only on
 real data (1.7% of STR training data), instead of on both synthetic and real
 data from scratch. Experiments show that the proposed method can recognize
 text from complex backgrounds more effectively, achieving state-of-the-art
 performance on several public datasets.'
