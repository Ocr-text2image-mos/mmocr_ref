Abstract: 'Recently, inspired by Transformer, self-attention-based scene text
recognition approaches have achieved outstanding performance. However, we find
that the size of model expands rapidly with the lexicon increasing. Specifically,
the number of parameters for softmax classification layer and output embedding
layer are proportional to the vocabulary size. It hinders the development of a
lightweight text recognition model especially applied for Chinese and multiple
languages. Thus, we propose a lightweight scene text recognition model named
Hamming OCR. In this model, a novel Hamming classifier, which adopts locality
sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm to encode each character, is proposed to
replace the softmax regression and the generated LSH code is directly employed
to replace the output embedding. We also present a simplified transformer
decoder to reduce the number of parameters by removing the feed-forward network
and using cross-layer parameter sharing technique. Compared with traditional
methods, the number of parameters in both classification and embedding layers
is independent on the size of vocabulary, which significantly reduces the
storage requirement without loss of accuracy. Experimental results on several
datasets, including four public benchmaks and a Chinese text dataset synthesized
by SynthText with more than 20,000 characters, shows that Hamming OCR achieves
competitive results.'
