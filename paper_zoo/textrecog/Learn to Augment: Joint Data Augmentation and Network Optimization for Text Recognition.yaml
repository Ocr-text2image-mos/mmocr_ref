Abstract: 'Handwritten text and scene text suffer from various shapes and
distorted patterns. Thus training a robust recognition model requires a large
amount of data to cover diversity as much as possible. In contrast to data
collection and annotation, data augmentation is a low cost way. In this paper,
we propose a new method for text image augmentation. Different from traditional
augmentation methods such as rotation, scaling and perspective transformation,
our proposed augmentation method is designed to learn proper and efficient data
augmentation which is more effective and specific for training a robust
recognizer. By using a set of custom fiducial points, the proposed augmentation
method is flexible and controllable. Furthermore, we bridge the gap between the
isolated processes of data augmentation and network optimization by joint
learning. An agent network learns from the output of the recognition network
and controls the fiducial points to generate more proper training samples for
the recognition network. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks, including
regular scene text, irregular scene text and handwritten text, show that the
proposed augmentation and the joint learning methods significantly boost the
performance of the recognition networks. A general toolkit for geometric
augmentation is available1.'
