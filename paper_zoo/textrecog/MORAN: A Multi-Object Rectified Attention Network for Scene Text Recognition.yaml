Abstract: 'Irregular text is widely used. However, it is considerably difficult
to recognize because of its various shapes and distorted patterns. In this
paper, we thus propose a multi-object rectified attention network (MORAN) for
general scene text recognition. The MORAN consists of a multi-object
rectification network and an attention-based sequence recognition network. The
multi-object rectification network is designed for rectifying images that
contain irregular text. It decreases the difficulty of recognition and enables
the attention-based sequence recognition network to more easily read irregular
text. It is trained in a weak supervision way, thus requiring only images and
corresponding text labels. The attentionbased sequence recognition network
focuses on target characters and sequentially outputs the predictions. Moreover,
to improve the sensitivity of the attentionbased sequence recognition network,
a fractional pickup method is proposed for an attention-based decoder in the
training phase. With the rectification mechanism, the MORAN can read both
regular and irregular scene text. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks
are conducted, which show that the MORAN achieves state-of-the-art performance.
