Abstract: 'Scene text recognition (STR) has been an active research topic in
computer vision for years. To tackle this challenging problem, numerous
innovative methods have been successively proposed and incorporating linguistic
knowledge into STR models has recently become a prominent trend. In this work,
we first draw inspiration from the recent progress in Vision Transformer (ViT)
to construct a conceptually simple yet powerful vision STR model, which is built
upon ViT and outperforms previous state-of-the-art models for scene text
recognition, including both pure vision models and language-augmented methods.
To integrate linguistic knowledge, we further propose a Multi-Granularity
Prediction strategy to inject information from the language modality into the
model in an implicit way, i.e. , subword representations (BPE and WordPiece)
widely-used in NLP are introduced into the output space, in addition to the
conventional character level representation, while no independent language model
(LM) is adopted. The resultant algorithm (termed MGP-STR) is able to push the
performance envelop of STR to an even higher level. Specifically, it achieves
an average recognition accuracy of 93.35% on standard benchmarks. Code will be
released soon.'
