Abstract: 'Until recently, the number of public real-world text images was
insufficient for training scene text recognizers. Therefore, most modern
training methods rely on synthetic data and operate in a fully supervised
manner. Nevertheless, the amount of public real-world text images has increased
significantly lately, including a great deal of unlabeled data. Leveraging
these resources requires semi-supervised approaches; however, the few existing
methods do not account for vision-language multimodality structure and
therefore suboptimal for state-of-the-art multimodal architectures. To bridge
this gap, we present semi-supervised learning for multimodal text recognizers
(SemiMTR) that leverages unlabeled data at each modality training phase.
Notably, our method refrains from extra training stages and maintains the
current three-stage multimodal training procedure. Our algorithm starts by
pretraining the vision model through a single-stage training that unifies
self-supervised learning with supervised training. More specifically, we extend
an existing visual representation learning algorithm and propose the first
contrastivebased method for scene text recognition. After pretraining the
language model on a text corpus, we fine-tune the entire network via a
sequential, character-level, consistency regularization between weakly and
strongly augmented views of text images. In a novel setup, consistency is
enforced on each modality separately. Extensive experiments validate that
our method outperforms the current training schemes and achieves
stateof-the-art results on multiple scene text recognition benchmarks.
Code will be published upon publication.'
