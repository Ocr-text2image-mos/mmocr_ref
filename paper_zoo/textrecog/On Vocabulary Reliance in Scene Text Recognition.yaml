Abstract: 'The pursuit of high performance on public benchmarks has been the
driving force for research in scene text recognition, and notable progress has
been achieved. However, a close investigation reveals a startling fact that the
state-ofthe-art methods perform well on images with words within vocabulary but
generalize poorly to images with words outside vocabulary. We call this
phenomenon “vocabulary reliance”. In this paper, we establish an analytical
framework to conduct an in-depth study on the problem of vocabulary reliance
in scene text recognition. Key findings include: (1) Vocabulary reliance is
ubiquitous, i.e., all existing algorithms more or less exhibit such
characteristic; (2) Attention-based decoders prove weak in generalizing to
words outside vocabulary and segmentation-based decoders perform well in
utilizing visual features; (3) Context modeling is highly coupled with the
prediction layers. These findings provide new insights and can benefit future
research in scene text recognition. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet
effective mutual learning strategy to allow models of two families
(attention-based and segmentationbased) to learn collaboratively. This remedy
alleviates the problem of vocabulary reliance and improves the overall scene
text recognition performance.'
