Abstract: 'Scene text recognition (STR) attracts much attention over the years
because of its wide application. Most methods train STR model in a fully
supervised manner which requires large amounts of labeled data. Although
synthetic data contributes a lot to STR, it suffers from the real-tosynthetic
domain gap that restricts model performance. In this work, we aim to boost
STR models by leveraging both synthetic data and the numerous real unlabeled
images, exempting human annotation cost thoroughly. A robust consistency
regularization based semi-supervised framework is proposed for STR, which can
effectively solve the instability issue due to domain inconsistency between
synthetic and real images. A character-level consistency regularization is
designed to mitigate the misalignment between characters in sequence recognition.
Extensive experiments on standard text recognition benchmarks demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method. It can steadily improve existing
STR models, and boost an STR model to achieve new state-of-the-art results.
To our best knowledge, this is the first consistency regularization based
framework that applies successfully to STR.'
