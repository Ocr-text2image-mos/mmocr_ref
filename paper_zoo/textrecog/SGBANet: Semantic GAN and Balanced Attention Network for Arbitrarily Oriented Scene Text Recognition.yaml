Abstract: 'Scene text recognition is a challenging task due to the complex
backgrounds and diverse variations of text instances. In this paper, we
propose a novel Semantic GAN and Balanced Attention Network (SGBANet) to
recognize the texts in scene images. The proposed method first generates
the simple semantic feature using Semantic GAN and then recognizes the scene
text with the Balanced Attention Module. The Semantic GAN aims to align the
semantic feature distribution between the support domain and target domain.
Different from the conventional image-to-image translation methods that
perform at the image level, the Semantic GAN performs the generation and
discrimination on the semantic level with the Semantic Generator Module
(SGM) and Semantic Discriminator Module (SDM). For target images (scene text
images), the Semantic Generator Module generates simple semantic features
that share the same feature distribution with support images (clear text
images). The Semantic Discriminator Module is used to distinguish the semantic
features between the support domain and target domain. In addition, a
Balanced Attention Module is designed to alleviate the problem of attention
drift. The Balanced Attention Module first learns a balancing parameter based
on the visual glimpse vector and semantic glimpse vector, and then performs
the balancing operation for obtaining a balanced glimpse vector. Experiments
on six benchmarks, including regular datasets, i.e., IIIT5K, SVT, ICDAR2013,
and irregular datasets, i.e., ICDAR2015, SVTP, CUTE80, validate the
effectiveness of our proposed method.'
