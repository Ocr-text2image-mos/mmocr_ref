Abstract: 'Arbitrary text appearance poses a great challenge in scene text
recognition tasks. Existing works mostly handle with the problem in
consideration of the shape distortion, including perspective distortions, line
curvature or other style variations. Rectification (i.e., spatial transformers)
as the preprocessing stage is one popular approach and extensively studied.
However, chromatic difficulties in complex scenes have not been paid much
attention on. In this work, we introduce a new learnable geometric-unrelated
rectification, StructurePreserving Inner Offset Network (SPIN), which allows
the color manipulation of source data within the network. This differentiable
module can be inserted before any recognition architecture to ease the
downstream tasks, giving neural networks the ability to actively transform
input intensity rather than only the spatial rectification. It can also serve
 as a complementary module to known spatial transformations and work in both
 independent and collaborative ways with them. Extensive experiments show the
 proposed transformation outperforms existing rectification networks and has
 comparable performance among the state-of-the-arts.'
