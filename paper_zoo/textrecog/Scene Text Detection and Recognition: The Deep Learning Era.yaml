Abstract: 'With the rise and development of deep learning, computer vision has
been tremendously transformed and reshaped. As an important research area in
computer vision, scene text detection and recognition has been inevitably
influenced by this wave of revolution, consequently entering the era of
deep learning. In recent years, the community has witnessed substantial
advancements in mindset, methodology and performance. This survey is aimed at
summarizing and analyzing the major changes and significant progresses of
scene text detection and recognition in the deep learning era. Through this
article, we devote to: (1) introduce new insights and ideas; (2) highlight
recent techniques and benchmarks; (3) look ahead into future trends.
Specifically, we will emphasize the dramatic differences brought by deep
learning and remaining grand challenges. We expect that this review paper
would serve as a reference book for researchers in this field.'
