Abstract: 'Recognizing irregular text in natural scene images is challenging due
to the large variance in text appearance, such as curvature, orientation and
distortion. Most existing approaches rely heavily on sophisticated model designs
and/or extra fine-grained annotations, which, to some extent, increase the
difficulty in algorithm implementation and data collection. In this work, we
propose an easy-to-implement strong baseline for irregular scene text
recognition, using offthe-shelf neural network components and only word-level
annotations. It is composed of a 31-layer ResNet, an LSTMbased encoder-decoder
framework and a 2-dimensional attention module. Despite its simplicity, the
proposed method is robust. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on irregular
text recognition benchmarks and comparable results on regular text datasets.
