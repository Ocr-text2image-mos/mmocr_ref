Abstract: 'Recently self-supervised representation learning has drawn
considerable attention from the scene text recognition community. Different
from previous studies using contrastive learning, we tackle the issue from an
alternative perspective, i.e., by formulating the representation learning
scheme in a generative manner. Typically, the neighboring image patches among
one text line tend to have similar styles, including the strokes, textures,
colors, etc. Motivated by this common sense, we augment one image patch and
use its neighboring patch as guidance to recover itself. Specifically, we
propose a Similarity-Aware Normalization (SimAN) module to identify the
different patterns and align the corresponding styles from the guiding patch.
In this way, the network gains representation capability for distinguishing
complex patterns such as messy strokes and cluttered backgrounds. Experiments
show that the proposed SimAN significantly improves the representation quality
and achieves promising performance. Moreover, we surprisingly find that our
self-supervised generative network has impressive potential for data synthesis,
text image editing, and font interpolation, which suggests that the proposed
SimAN has a wide range of practical applications.'
