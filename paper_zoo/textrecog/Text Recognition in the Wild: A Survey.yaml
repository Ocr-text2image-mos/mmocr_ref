Abstract: 'The history of text can be traced back over thousands of years. Rich
and precise semantic information carried by text is important in a wide range of
vision-based application scenarios. Therefore, text recognition in natural
scenes has been an active research field in computer vision and pattern
recognition. In recent years, with the rise and development of deep learning,
numerous methods have shown promising in terms of innovation, practicality,
and efficiency. This paper aims to (1) summarize the fundamental problems and
the state-of-the-art associated with scene text recognition; (2) introduce new
insights and ideas; (3) provide a comprehensive review of publicly available
resources; (4) point out directions for future work. In summary, this
literature review attempts to present the entire picture of the field of
scene text recognition. It provides a comprehensive reference for people
entering this field, and could be helpful to inspire future research.
