Abstract: 'Recent works in the text recognition area have pushed forward the
recognition results to the new horizons. But for a long time a lack of large
human-labeled natural text recognition datasets has been forcing researchers
to use synthetic data for training text recognition models. Even though
synthetic datasets are very large (MJSynth and SynthText, two most famous
synthetic datasets, have several million images each), their diversity could
be insufficient, compared to natural datasets like ICDAR and others.
Fortunately, the recently released text recognition annotation for OpenImages
V5 dataset has comparable with synthetic dataset number of instances and more
diverse examples. We have used this annotation with a Text Recognition head
architecture from the Yet Another Mask Text Spotter and got comparable to the
SOTA results. On some datasets we have even outperformed previous SOTA models.
In this paper we also introduce a text recognition model. The modelâ€™s code is
available.'
